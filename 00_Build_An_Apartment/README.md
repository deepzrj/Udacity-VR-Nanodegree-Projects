The project took nearly a day for me to complete,
One of the things I particularly liked about doing this project was the arrangemt of apartment manually.
One of the major thing that i found challenging was triggers. I found it hard to hard to understand. I also faced difficulty understanding lighting and I still have doubts regarding it.

Lightmap RESOLUTION
2:-dimly lit, shadows are not that visible
5:- shadows intensified compared to '2'
40:- lights n shadows are more projected
80:-lights are directional and shadows casted are dark n deep.
